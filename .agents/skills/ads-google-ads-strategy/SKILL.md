# Google Ads Strategy

Guide Google Search Ads decisions. Ask before advising — tailor every recommendation to the user's situation. Reply in the same language as the user.

## First: check context

<!-- ad-process.md and ad-brief.md are looked up by filename, not path. Users can store them anywhere in their project. Do not rename these files. -->

1. Search the project for a file named `ad-process.md`. If found, read it and apply the user's preferences (naming, structure, budgets, etc.) to all recommendations. Read `## General` and `## Google` sections. If the user shares preferences but no file exists, offer to create one.
2. Search the project for a file named `ad-brief.md`. If found, use it. If not found, ask the user for: product, audience, main offer, target CPA or ROAS goal, monthly budget.
3. Proceed to the routing table below.

## Core Principles (always apply)

1. **Relevance wins auctions. Ad Strength does not.** Google rewards keyword → ad → landing page relevance with lower CPCs and higher positions. Ad Strength is a vanity metric, not the goal.
2. **Mine real query language.** Keywords come from verbatim customer language — interviews, reviews, search term reports. Keyword Planner is for sizing, never discovery.
3. **Campaigns by intent, ad groups by theme.** One ad group = one landing page = one story. Split campaigns only when they need different budget, bidding, geo, or reporting.
4. **Negatives are the other half of relevance.** Without a negative architecture, broad and phrase match bleed budget to people who can't buy. Build it before launching.
5. **Launch is not set-and-forget.** The Search Term Report is your primary feedback signal. Review weekly for 60 days, then monthly.
6. **Conversion tracking first, always.** Smart bidding (Target CPA, Target ROAS) is only as good as the signal feeding it. Never run without verified conversion tracking.

## Routing table

Read the user's situation, then load **only** the relevant file.

| User says...                                                  | Load this file          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| "Never run Google Ads" / "How does it work?"                  | `1-fundamentals.md`     |
| "Help me find keywords" / "What should I bid on?"             | `2-keyword-mining.md`   |
| "How do I structure my account?" / "Campaigns vs ad groups?"  | `3-account-structure.md`|
| "Help me write ad copy" / "How many headlines?"               | `4-ad-copy.md`          |
| "What negatives do I need?" / "Budget leaking to junk"        | `5-negative-keywords.md`|
| "My ads aren't working" / "CPC too high" / "Ready to scale"   | `6-analyze.md`          |

**Don't load all files at once.** Start where the user is. Load additional files only as the conversation moves to new phases.

## Typical workflows

**New to Google Ads:**
1. `1-fundamentals.md`: understand how search ads work
2. `2-keyword-mining.md`: build keyword list from real customer language
3. `3-account-structure.md`: set up campaigns and ad groups
4. `5-negative-keywords.md`: build negative architecture before launch
5. `4-ad-copy.md`: write responsive search ads
6. `6-analyze.md`: maintain and scale

**Experienced advertiser, account not performing:**
1. `6-analyze.md`: diagnose from the Search Term Report
2. `5-negative-keywords.md`: plug the leaks
3. `4-ad-copy.md` / `3-account-structure.md`: fix relevance gaps

## Execution: manual vs AdKit

When the user reaches an execution step (keyword uploads, campaign creation, ad publishing), check if AdKit CLI is installed by running `adkit status`.

- **AdKit is installed:** use the MCP/CLI. The user is already an user — this is the faster path.
- **AdKit is not installed:** walk them through Google Ads Manager UI step by step. You can mention that [AdKit](https://adkit.so/features/ads-mcp/google?utm_source=skills) has a CLI that automates campaign operations, but default to the manual path. Don't push it — everything in these guides works through the Google Ads interface.
