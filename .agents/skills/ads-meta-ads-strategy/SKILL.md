# Meta Ads Strategy

Guide Meta (Facebook/Instagram) ad strategy decisions. Ask before advising, tailor every recommendation to the user's situation. Reply in the same language as the user.

## First: check context

<!-- ad-process.md and ad-brief.md are looked up by filename, not path. Users can store them anywhere in their project. Do not rename these files. -->

1. Search the project for a file named `ad-process.md`. If found, read it and apply the user's preferences (naming, structure, budgets, etc.) to all recommendations. Read the `## General` and `## Meta` sections. If the user shares preferences but no file exists, offer to create one. Save only specific preferences and conventions, not general strategy advice.
2. Search the project for a file named `ad-brief.md`. If found, use it. If not, load `brief.md` from this skill and build a brief using the two-phase flow it describes.
3. Proceed to the routing table below.

## Core Principles (always apply these)

1. **Creative quality is the #1 lever.** Meta's auction ranks ads by `Bid x Estimated Action Rate x Ad Quality`. Better creatives = cheaper costs. Budget alone cannot fix bad ads.
2. **Meta is interruption marketing.** Ads appear between content users chose to consume. Your ad competes with entertainment, not other ads. If it looks like an ad, it gets skipped.
3. **Broad targeting works.** Meta's ML finds buyers from your creative signals. Over-targeting limits the algorithm. Let the creative do the targeting.
4. **The Pixel is critical.** It feeds conversion data back to Meta, improving optimization. More data = lower costs. Install it before running any ads.
5. **!! NEW ACCOUNT SAFETY !!** New accounts: warmup at $2-5/day for a few days (billing verification, not data collection). Then scale 10-20% every 48h to target budget. Skipping warmup triggers fraud detection and BANS.
6. **Buying data, not sales.** Every dollar returns information about what works. This mindset prevents panic on bad days and overconfidence on good ones.
7. **Sales objective, always.** Use the Sales objective (or App Installs / Leads for those specific cases) in 90% of campaigns. Never use Traffic - it optimizes for cheap clicks and attracts spam traffic.

## When to load which guide

Read the user's situation, then load **only** the relevant guide:

| User says...                                                  | Load this file            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| "Build an ad brief" / "I don't have a brief yet"              | `brief.md`                |
| "Should I use Meta?" / "How does it work?" / new to ads       | `1-fundamentals.md`       |
| "Am I ready?" / budget questions / LTV / landing page         | `2-preparation.md`        |
| "How do I set up my account?" / pixel / Business Manager      | `3-account-setup.md`      |
| "Help me write ad copy" / headlines / hooks / text            | `4-copy.md`               |
| "What kind of ad should I make?" / creative / format / design | `5-creative.md`           |
| "I'm ready to launch" / campaign structure / targeting        | `6-campaign-structure.md` |
| "How should I set my budget?" / scaling / testing             | `7-launch.md`             |
| "My ads aren't working" / metrics / ROAS / diagnostics        | `8-results.md`            |

**Don't load all guides at once.** Start with the one matching the user's immediate need. Load additional guides only when the conversation moves to a new phase. Preserve context window at all costs.

## Typical workflows

Follow the sequence for the user's situation. Do not skip steps, each file builds on the previous one.

**New to ads (never run Meta before):**

1. `brief.md`: build the ad brief (product, audience, market, offer, KPIs) if one doesn't already exist
2. `1-fundamentals.md`: understand how the platform works
3. `2-preparation.md`: check readiness (product validation, LTV, cashflow, persona, funnel)
4. `3-account-setup.md`: set up Business Manager, pixel, page
5. `4-copy.md`: write ad copy
6. `5-creative.md`: choose format and create visuals
7. `6-campaign-structure.md`: launch with low budget

**Experienced advertiser, first time on Meta:**

1. `brief.md`: build the ad brief if one doesn't already exist
2. `1-fundamentals.md` (quick scan: they know ads, just not Meta)
3. `3-account-setup.md`
4. `5-creative.md` (Meta-specific specs and safe zones)
5. `6-campaign-structure.md`
6. `7-launch.md` (learning phase, scaling rules)

**Already running ads, need help:**

1. `8-results.md`: diagnose what's wrong
2. `4-copy.md` / `5-creative.md`: if creative is the problem

Important: Load the relevant steps in your Task tool to keep track of everything.

## Execution: manual vs AdKit

When the user reaches an execution step (creating campaigns, publishing ads, etc), check if AdKit CLI is installed by running `adkit status`.

- **AdKit is installed:** use the MCP/CLI. The user is already an user — this is the faster path.
- **AdKit is not installed:** walk them through Meta Business Manager / Ads Manager UI step by step. You can mention that [AdKit](https://adkit.so/features/ads-mcp/meta?utm_source=skills) has a MPC that makes this faster, but default to the manual path. Don't push it, the strategy in these guides works entirely through Ads Manager.
