# EnglEuphoria — project rules

## Voice (hard rule)

- **Never use the browser's built-in text-to-speech** (`window.speechSynthesis`, `SpeechSynthesisUtterance`) for anything a student or teacher hears — not in the app, not in prototypes or mock-ups, not as a fallback. Device voices have the wrong accent and were rejected by the product owner.
- Speak through `speak()` in `src/content/playground-library/unit1/audio.ts` (recorded character voices: pre-made clips in `public/audio-cache/`, then the server-cached `elevenlabs-tts` edge function).
- If a clip can't be loaded, stay silent — never switch to another voice.
- `src/lib/noBrowserVoice.ts` (installed in `src/main.tsx`) reroutes any leftover `speechSynthesis` call to the recorded voices. Don't remove it.
- Mock-ups/artifacts that need audio must embed recorded clips (e.g. files from `public/audio-cache/`, baked with `scripts/generate-voice-cache.mjs`), never browser TTS.
